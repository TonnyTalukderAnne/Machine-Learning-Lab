In classification, the goal is to assign a discrete label to an input, such as \"spam\" or \"not spam\" for an email. In regression, the goal is to predict a continuous value, such as the price of a house or the age of a person. Both tasks require a training dataset that contains input-output pairs, and a learning algorithm that can find a function that maps the inputs to the outputs. The performance of the classifier or regressor can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error, or R-squared."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"39a91f9b","metadata":{"id":"39a91f9b"},"source":["**4.1 Importing pandas**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"2da494cc","metadata":{"id":"2da494cc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1755756221459,"user_tz":-360,"elapsed":588,"user":{"displayName":"Tonny Talukder Anne (SK)","userId":"17554784155505570114"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"de88ed6a","metadata":{"id":"de88ed6a"},"source":["**4.2 Importing Data Set**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c9c4b039","metadata":{"id":"c9c4b039"},"source":["The zoo dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/111/zoo) will be used for this task.
